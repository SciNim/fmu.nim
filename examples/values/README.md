# values.nim
## Compilation
```sh
nim c -r -d:fmu values.nim
```

## Testing
```sh
../fmuCheck.linux64 -h 1 -s 14 -f -l 6 -e values.log values.fmu
```
This creates the log file: [values.log](https://github.com/mantielero/fmu.nim/blob/main/examples/values/values.log).

It also displays the following results:
